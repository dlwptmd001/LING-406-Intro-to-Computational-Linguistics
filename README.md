# LING-406-Intro-to-Computational-Linguistics

## Course Descriptions

This course is an introduction to the field of computational linguistics / natural language
processing (NLP). After covering the linguistics and computational fundamentals of
morphology, syntax, and semantics, the focus shifts to the integration of these modules
into complex natural-language processing systems. In addition to natural language
understanding, the course presents advanced material on various applications of natural
language processing. This course provides the theoretical foundation for further study in
this field and hands-on experience in working with text collections.
